# code-refactoring-horiseon

## Description 

I combined any events in the CSS file that had the same properties.  I also relocated events to follow the HTML page.  In the index.html file, I changed the divs to follow HTML semantics.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).


## Installation

I opened index.html in Google Chrome.


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
